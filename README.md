# GrapheryExecutor

Graphery Executor Module is a python script execution sever and part of Graphery. It's inspired by [PySnooper](https://github.com/cool-RR/PySnooper) and [PyTutor](https://github.com/okpy/pytutor) and uses a wrapped version of [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) for graph support. 

More detail coming soon.
