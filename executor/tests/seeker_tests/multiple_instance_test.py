# check if it's evaluation first or inspection first? I bet it's evaluation first,
# so I need to prepare the store space for the next line. ANSWER: no I don't need prepare a new dict
# but the evaluation does come first, the the 'access' field comes after.
# I need the make access a dict, since there may be multiple accesses in one line

# use just one tracer instance or multiple tracer instance?
# I support multiple tracers
# 1. pro: easier to manage con: may affect coding styles
# 2. pro: users have more controls to their codes.
#    con: multiple watch list is difficult for users to manage

# TODO what python version to support?
